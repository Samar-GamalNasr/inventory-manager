🛍️ Simple Store Management System

This project is a beginner-friendly Store Management System written in Python, designed to help new programmers learn how to structure, validate, and manage data effectively using fundamental programming concepts.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to simulate a simple store environment where the user can:

Add items to the store inventory

Validate user input (names, prices, quantities)

Display available products

Update or delete existing items

It focuses on clean logic, modular design, and error handling without using advanced or unintroduced topics — making it ideal for those still building their programming foundation.

🧩 Features

Input validation for product name, price, and quantity

Safe handling of invalid or unexpected inputs

Clear and user-friendly console interface

Step-by-step implementation following educational guidance

🧠 Learning Objectives

This project helps the learner practice:

Writing clean and readable Python code

Using lists and dictionaries for data storage

Implementing validation functions

Structuring small-scale programs into logical parts

Understanding how to handle user input safely

🚀 Next Steps

Future updates will include:

Search and filter functionality

Persistent data storage (saving to a file or database)

Enhanced interface and report generation
